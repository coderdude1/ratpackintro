# Ratpack Intro
Me walking thru the [online manual](https://ratpack.io/manual/current/index.html)

The ratpack manual is pretty good overall, but I like to run the code, and found that the examples
either had compile errors, or was missing stuff to actually run the examples.  I've
added the missing pieces as I work through this.

Everything should be runnable in IntelliJ.  At some point I'll try to rewrite
the java stuff into Kotlin

Added the Apache license as that is what the original source uses
